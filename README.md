Diray Webapp
-------------------------

This ia a basic Django CRUD app that allows users to write their diary. Users are required to create an account and login to edit and view their own diaries. 
The data is stored in the built-in SQLite databse. <br>

By making use of ckeditor, users are not restricted to plain text for their diary. 
Instead, they are able to make fancy styles and emoji because the app is able to store those formated text in a modified Django CharField.
